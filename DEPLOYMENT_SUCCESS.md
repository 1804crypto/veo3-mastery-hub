# ✅ Final Deployment Steps Initiated

I have confirmed that your backend is running at:
`https://veo3-mastery-hubveo3-mastery-hub-api.onrender.com`

I have automatically performed the following actions for you:
1.  **Updated Netlify:** Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the working URL above.
2.  **Triggered Deploy:** Started a fresh "Deploy without cache" on Netlify.

## What to do now:
1.  Wait for the Netlify deploy to finish (approx 1-2 mins).
2.  Visit your site: `https://veo3-mastery-hub.netlify.app`
3.  **It should now work perfectly!** The backend connection will be established, and the CORS error should be gone.

Enjoy your deployed app! 🚀
